This Vite.js app is a frontend, which communicates asynchronously with our Laravel backend Api.

Make sure to use a Bearer Token authentication for all Api requests to the backend requiring authentication, which can be retrieved from the local storage after the user succesfully authenticates.

Store all environment-specific context variables in .env files.

Use lazy to import the components and the loader functions.

I am using pnpm as a package manager.
